Instructions to run SchoolAssist: 

Clone the github repo to your machine. Then, navigate to the "demo_app" directory ("$cd demo_app" from the initial 
"AddisMarchettiASDIHacks" directory), and run "$npm install". After this, you must first run the CORS Proxy server used 
to call our public API's. Do this by navigating to the "cors-anywhere" folder located in the demo_app
 folder ("$cd/demo_app/cors-anywhere from the AddisMarchettiASDIHacks directory) and in the cors-anywhere folder 
 run "$node server.js"

 **NOTE: cors-anywhere should run on 0.0.0.0:8080 - if it runs on something else, then you must
  change the URL in the "demo_app.src/apiControlloer/apiControllor.tsx" file; modify the fetch statements 
  in the "getSchoolFromCoordinates" and "getGeoIdFromZip" methods from "fetch(http://localhost:8080/{rest of url})" 
  to  "fetch(http://localhost:{ur-cors-anywhere-port}/{rest of url})"

 After this, navigate to demo_app ("$cd demo_app" from the demoFramework directory), in a new 
 terminal window and run "$npm start".
